# Printf
This is my implementation of the printf function, callable from C. It is also written in NASM.
## Output types
+ %s <=> string
+ %c <=> char
+ %d <=> decimal number
+ %h <=> hex number
+ %o <=> octal number
+ %b <=> binary number
## Peculiarity
Implemented jump table, which speeds up the function
